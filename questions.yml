# AWS Training notes

S3:
  - Encryption:
    - SSE-S3 - S3 Managed Keys (AKA "SSE-S3" server-side encryption for S3)
    - Amazon manages these keys
    - SSE-KMS - Amazon and user-managed keys
    - SSE-C - Server side encryption with customer keys
    - Dry encryption - when a file is encrypted before being uploaded
  - Buckets created are private by default:
    - When versioning is turned on, and when a file is re-uploaded, the file is turned back to private.
  - Versioning:
    - The file sizes of the total versions account for the total bucket size:
      - to reduce the bucket size of versioned buckets, adjust life cycle policy to retire older versions 
      - versioning stores all versions of an object (including all writes and object deletions)
    - Life cycle rules:
      - can apply to only tagged objects
      - can transition to other types of buckets, such as Glacier, etc.
      - can clean up incomplete multi-part updloads
    - Exam tips:
      - Great backup tool
      - once enabled, cannot be disabled, only suspended
      - integrates with lifecycle rules
      - versioning's MFA (multi-factor authentication) Delete, which provides additional security for object deletions
      - Automates moving upjects between different storage tiers
      - can be used in conj with versioning
      - Can be applied to current versinos and previous versions
  - Object lock:
    - AKA "S3 Object Lock"
    - can make objects unmodifiable and undeletable
    - uses a "WORM" (Write Once, Ready Many) model
    - can help meet regulatory requirements for extra layer of protection against object changes/deletion
  - Governance mode:
    - users cannot overwrite or delete an object version, or alter its "lock settings"
    - can grant some users permission to alter retention settings or delete an object if necessary
  - Compliance mode:
    - protected object can't be overwritten by ANY user (even root)
    - retention mode can't be cahnged
    - retention period can't be shortened
  - Retention period: 
    - protects an object version for a fixed amount of time.
    - S3 stores timestamp in the objects metadata
    - after retention period expires, the object VERSION can be overwritten or deleted (unless a legal hold is also placed on the object)
  - Legal hold:
    - prevents an S3 object version from being overwritten or deleted
    - unlike a retention period, a legal hold remains in effect until removed
    - can be freely placed by users who have the "s3:PutObjectLegalHold" permission
  - Glacier Vault Lock:
    - allows you to specify controls (such as WORM) in a Vault Lock policy and "lock" the policy from future edits.
    - Once a policy has been locked, it can no longer be changed

  - Performance:
    - How fast can you get the first byte out of S3?:
      - You can get the first byte out of S3 within 100-200 milliseconds
    - How can you get better "read" performance across different prefixes?:
      - You can get better performance by spreading your reads across different prefixes
      - Prefixes are the sections of data ('strings') in the path between the bucket name and the object name (e.g. "bucketName00/[Folder1/Sub-folder1]/ObjectName.txt")
    - What are the number of requests per prefix?:
      - 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE
      - 5,500 GET/HEAD
      - e.g. 5,500 GET requests for one prefix. Doubled across two prefixes (total 11,000).
    - Limits:
      - What is "KMS"?:
        - Upload/Downloads count toward KMS quota
        - KMS limits are region-specific (however, it's either 5,500, 10,000, or 30, 000 requests per second)
        - Currently, you cannot request a quota increase for KMS
      - If you are using SS3-KMS to encrypt S3 objects, what limits can you run into?:
        - e.g. when uploading a file, the "GenerateDataKey" KMS API is called
        - e.g. when a file is downloaded, the KMS API is called to decrypt the object, etc

  - Uploads:
    - What is "Multi-part"?:
      - Splitting files into parts for multiple parallel uploads
      - Recommended for files over 100 MB
      - Required for files over 5 GB
      - Parallelize uploads to increase effeciency

  - Downloads:
    - What are "S3 Byte-Range Fetches"?:
      - Used to speed up downloads and to download specific parts of a download (header info, etc)
      - Parallelize downloads by specifying byte ranges
      - If there's a failure in the download, it's only for a specific byte range (which won't interrupt the entire process)

  - What is "SE Select"?:
    - Enables apps to retrieve only a subset of data from an object by using SQL expressions
    - SE Select only retrieves the data needed by your applied
    - Can drastically increase performance
    - Can get as much as 400% improvement
    - Bypass steps required to download or uncompress archived data (e.g. zip files)
  - What is "Glacier Select"?:
    - Allows companies to write data directly to Amazon Glacier to satisfy compliance needs (like SEC Rule 17a-4 or HIPAA)

  - Sharing S3 Buckets across accounts:
    - What are the 3 different ways to share S3 buckets?:
      - Using bucket policies and IAM (applies to entire bucket). Programmatic access only.
      - Using bucket ACLs (applies to individual objects). Programmatic access only.
      - Cross-account IAM roles. Programmatic AND Cosole access.

  - Cross-region replication:
    - What are the types of storage types for S3 buckets?:
      - Standard - Availability > 3 zones, Min storage duration = Null, Min billable objects = Null
      - Standard IA - Availability = 1 zone, Min storage duration = 30 Days, Min billable objects = 128 Kb
      - One Zone-IA - Availability > 3 zones, Min storage duration = 30 Days, Min billable objects = 128 Kb
      - Reduced Redundancy - Availability > 3 zones, Min storage duration = Null, Min billable objects = Null
      - Intelligent Tiering - Availability > 3 zones, Min storage duration = 30 Days, Min billable objects = Null
      - Glacier - Availability > 3 zones, Min storage duration = 90 Days, Min billable objects = Null
      - Glacier Deep Archive - Availability > 3 zones, Min storage duration = 180 Days, Min billable objects = Null
    - What is Replication Time Control (RTC)?:
      - RTC replicates 99.99% of objects within 15 minutes.
      - When enabled, replication metrics are also enabled per rule, and an additional per-GB data transfer fee applies.
    - Do objects start replicating when you turn on replication?:
      - No. Only new objects are replicated after you turn on replication.
    - When you change public permissions on a file, do they replicate to other regions?:
      - Yes! Bucket permissions on files replicate throughout regions.
      - This only occurs when a new object is created or updated.
    - Exam tips:
      - Versioning must be enabled on both source and destination buckets 
      - Files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically 
      - Subsequent updates to files will be replicated automatically  
      - Delete markers are not replicated
      - Delete individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated
  
  - Transfer Accelleration:
    - What is S3 Transfer Accelleration?:
      - S3 TA utilizes the CloudFront Edge Network to accellerate uploads to S3
      - Instead of uploading to a bucket, you can upload to a URL to an edge location, which will then transfer that file to S3

  - Data Sync:
    - What is Data Sync?: 
      - Data Sync allows you to move large amounts of data into AWS
      - Typically used in on-prem data centers where you install a Data Sync agent
      - The agent would connect to your NAS or file system then copy data to AWS
      - Automatically encrypts data over the WAN
      - Performs automatic data integrity checks "in transit" and "at rest"
      - Seamlessly connects to Amazon S3, Elastic File System (EFS), or Amazon FSX for Windows file server 
      - Syncing can be done hourly, daily, or weekly
    - Exam tips:
      - Used to move LARGE AMOUNTS of data from on-prem to AWS
      - Used with NFS and SMB-compatible systems
      - Replication can be done hourly, daily, or weekly
      - Install the DataSync agent to start replication
      - Can be used to replicate EFS to EFS

  - CloudFront:
    - 


# Misc CI/CD stuff from other websites
Containerization:
- What is Hypervisor?:
  - Hypervisor essentially allows you to spin up containers.
