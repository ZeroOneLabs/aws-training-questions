# aws-training-questions
AWS training questions I've written down to help me study for exams, etc. Hoping to turn this YAML file into a Python program that can create flash cards with Flask or whatever. 

## What am I?
This repo is to store an array of information about AWS tech in the format of YAML so I can write an easy Python program wrapper to use this data to present it in the form of flash cards for studying.

Do what you will with this information as you may. It's stuff I've written down free-hand while taking training classes. They may contain errors, so double-check this information on AWS's documentation!
